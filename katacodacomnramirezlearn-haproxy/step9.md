The table below shows the values that you can set for `balance`:

| Balance                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `first`                | Chooses the first server listed that has available connection slots. Once that server's connections exceeds its `maxconn` setting, HAProxy sends connections to the second server listed, and so on. Be sure to set `maxconn` on each `server` line for this to work. This works well in environments where servers are added and removed depending on load. |
| `hdr( <name> )`        | Creates a hash of the given HTTP header and then associates that hash with one of the servers so that the same server is always chosen for the given hash. This works best when there is sufficient variability in the header value (e.g. you operate many web domains with different  *Host* header values).                                                |
| `leastconn`            | Chooses the server with the fewest active connections from among all servers. This is advantageous when server sessions are long-lived, since it avoids over-utilizing a busy server.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `random( <draws> )`    | Chooses a random server from a subset of the servers. The size of the subset is determined by the  `draws` parameter, which defaults to two. This algorithm is advantageous when operating multiple load balancers that need to choose least loaded servers based only on non-shared information.                                                            |
| `rdp-cookie( <name> )` | Creates a hash of the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol cookie that is mapped to a user connecting with RDP and associates the hash with a server. By default, the cookie name is  *mstshash*.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `roundrobin`           | Chooses each server in turn, starting with the first server listed. This algorithm provides a fair distribution of load when server response times are relatively quick and uniform, such as with HTTP web applications.                                                                                                                                     |
| `source`               | Creates a hash of the client's source IP address and uses it to always send that client to the same server. This is helpful for persisting clients to the same servers when in TCP mode, wherein cookies cannot be used.                                                                                                                                     |
| `static-rr`            | This is the same as the `roundrobin` algorithm, except that while `roundrobin` is limited to 4095 active servers per `backend`, there is no such limitation here. However, changing a server's  weight will have no effect.                                                                                                                                  |
| `uri`                  | Creates a hash of the URI, which is used to always choose the same server for the given hash. This helps improve cache-hit ratios when load balancing cache servers.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `url_param`            | Creates a hash of the URL parameter that is specified on the same line. This can be used to persist a client to the same server depending a URL parameter like  *session_id*.                                                                                                                                                                                |
